# Recipe Organizer App

## Background
In today's digital age, there is an overwhelming number of recipes available online, from blogs to social media platforms. As a cooking enthusiast, I found it challenging to keep track of all the recipes I come across. I wanted a simple way to organize, store, and manage these recipes in a personal cooking book. 

This app serves as a tool to help people keep recipes found online in an orderly fashion. It allows users to easily store and categorize their recipes, making it easy to access them whenever needed. 

## How It Works
The Recipe Organizer App is built using Python and Tkinter, with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to make it user-friendly. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its main features:

- **Add Recipes**: Users can add new recipes by providing the recipe name, ingredients, instructions, an image (via URL), and a link to a video tutorial (if available).
  
- **Recipe Categories**: Recipes can be categorized into pre-set categories such as: Desserts, Soups, Salads, etc. The user can select the category while adding a recipe, and the app will display the recipe under the chosen category.

- **View and Edit Recipes**: When a recipe is selected, users can view the full recipe with its instructions, image (if provided), and video link (if provided). A "Edit" option allows users to update existing recipes.

- **Comments Section**: In the recipe page users can add personal comments to each recipe, which can be useful for noting modifications or favorite variations.

## Features Overview
1. **Add a Recipe**: Fill out the recipe name, category, instructions, optional video link, and image URL.
2. **Organize Recipes**: Categorize recipes under labels such as "Main," "Dessert," and "Bread."
3. **View Recipe**: See the details of a selected recipe, including the instructions, image, and video link.
4. **Edit Recipe**: Update the recipe information or image.
5. **Comments**: Add notes or comments to each recipe for personal use.
